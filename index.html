                            Flowers are often considered a symbol of beauty, love, and affection. They can also represent various emotions and sentiments depending on the context and type of flower. For example, red roses are commonly associated with romantic love, while white lilies are often connected to purity and innocence. Different flowers may hold different symbolic meanings in different cultures and traditions as well.</p>
                        Miranda Kerr says,
                          <q>
                            A rose can never be a sunflower, and a sunflower can never be a rose.<br> All flowers are beautiful in their own way, and that's like women too.
